Hatter
======

Hatter is a simple python terminal application that prints hats to the console.

Hatter exists as an example of using Zanata with some other tools
to localise a software project.

The stages in this demo are represented by git commits, so that a diff between
commits will show you what has changed, and the commit messages should give a
reasonable idea of what has been done.


Usage
-----

To see all functions of hatter, try the following:

    ./hatter --help

Also, when prompted for a number of hats, try entering a non-integer (e.g. 'a')
to see the error message.
